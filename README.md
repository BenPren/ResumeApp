My Resume, as an app

Built using Android Studios.  Simply import the project as an Android gradle project if you would like to compile on your own.

The project targets version 15 as the minimum OS level.  This allows for use of modern design and libraries while still supporting 95% of the devices.  This will probably not change until the market share is version 17 and above as version 16 did not have significant changes.
